|   [Godot](https://godotengine.org) ![gobot](https://godotengine.org/assets/press/logo_large_color_light.png)| Godot is an open-source 2d/3d engine, rapidly growing engine, I really like it! |   Open-source, No Premium, Small.|  Less Features(for now),C# is a bit buggy, Basic 3D|   Godot Foundation/ Community! |
| [Unity](https://unity.com/) ![unityLogo](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/fuvbjjlp/production/01c082f3046cc45548249c31406aeffd0a9a738e-296x100.png) | Unity is a closed source Game Engine which is one of the most used platforms. It is most common within Moblie apps and VR development. | Feature-Rich(lot of built-in Packages), A LOT of reasources, Asset Store | Very shady creators, Premium subscriptions, a bit slow | Unity Technologies |
