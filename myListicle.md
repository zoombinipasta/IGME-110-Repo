|   [Godot](https://godotengine.org) ![gobot](https://godotengine.org/assets/press/logo_large_color_light.png)| Godot is an open-source 2d/3d engine, rapidly growing engine, I really like it! |   Open-source, No Premium, Small.|  Less Features(for now),C# is a bit buggy, Basic 3D|   Godot Foundation/ Community! |
| [Unity](https://unity.com/) ![unityLogo](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/fuvbjjlp/production/01c082f3046cc45548249c31406aeffd0a9a738e-296x100.png) | Unity is a closed source Game Engine which is one of the most used platforms. It is most common within Moblie apps and VR development. | Feature-Rich(lot of built-in Packages), A LOT of reasources, Asset Store | Very shady creators, Premium subscriptions, a bit slow | Unity Technologies |
| [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US) ![UnrealPicer](https://download.logo.wine/logo/Unreal_Engine/Unreal_Engine-Logo.wine.png) | Unreal Engine has the Highest Fideility Graphics on the market, with an actually good visual scripting language. a AAA engine at your fingertips| C++,Best Graphics, Easy Visual Programming, A lot of packages built-in/Asset Store | Huge size(70 GB), Runs Awful on lower-end, Asset store is full of garbage, C++| Epic Games|

| [Source 1](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source) ![s1Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Source_engine_logo_and_wordmark.svg/1200px-Source_engine_logo_and_wordmark.svg.png)| An old but truly incerable engine first used to build Hl2 but has since had proflic games built in it. Outdated but ot forgotten. | Lots of built in Assests, the most reasources, Multi-dicplanary options | Ancient and lacking features, Graphics are heavly dated, IDE's for it are disgustingly old (orgins in the 90s) | Valve |

Thats About it, I hope you enjoyed reading!
